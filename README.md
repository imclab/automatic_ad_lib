Automatic Ad Lib
================

The mesmerizing mechanical movement and sound of a split-flap display has been lost due to the mechanical complexity and decreasing price of digital display tools. Automatic Ad Lib repurposes the precise movements to precisely display random symbols. This project explores how utilitarian communication tools can be tools for open ended storytelling and how the method in which a message is transmitted impacts how it is perceived. The symbols on the flaps are part of a practical but incredibly powerful visual language. Although the icons are designed for rapid and universal understanding, they often have unintentional meaning depending on the adjacent environment.


Features & Changes
=======

- Powered by Arduino YÃºn to get local time to display
- Replaces gears in original BeachLab_flip_flap with timing belt and pulleys
- [Magnetic hall effect sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/product/158) provides card index for accurate display
- Uses [OpenBeam](http://www.openbeamusa.com) for construction
- Creative commons icons from the noun project. [Attributed here](http://itp.howtomworks.com/automatic-ad-lib-creative-commons-icons-attribution/)
- 3D printed stepper motor mount for inexpensive models available from [Skycraft Parts & Surplus](http://www.skycraftsurplus.com/) at the time of build
